Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank. Excuse me, I'm thirsty, so I'm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.",0
"For starters, they shed and bite. Hey, here's a thought.
Why don't we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs? So, we'd be, like, owners of a comic book store? It's kind of a dream come true. That does sound fun. Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place. I'll give you a plan right now. Step one: open comic book store. Step two: start rumor this comic book store gives you genital warts.",0
"You are dead meat I didn't know it was a big secret. No its not big, not at all. Kind of the same lines as, I don't know, having a third nipple!",1
I've had better. Okay! When?! All right! All right! It was the best nap ever! Uh-huh!,0
"Don't push me, Sheldon.
I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it. Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister. And I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation-- be it noogies, swirlies or the classic ""Why are you hitting yourself?"" Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.",1
"You can't go away this weekend, its Emma's birthday, we are having a party. Well can't you just have the party when we get back? No, it won't be her real birthday. Gee, if only she were one and had no idea what a birthday was.",1
"Y'know what, actually ..   Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here? I thought you didn't smoke. Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?",0
"Isn't she happy here? I think she will be happy with Gloria What about us? Whose gonna keep after us. Make us linguini and tell us story about Cicily. I don't know Rose, maybe Marry Poppins has an Italian cousin.",1
"It is, isn't it? (gasps) Oh, bother. Isn't that just always the way? 
You go to staple something, and you're out of staples. Gosh, I wish I'd known that earlier today when I was at Staples. You have a thing of paper clips right there.",0
"I just want to go back to my cell, cause in my cell I can smoke. Smoke away! I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.",1
"And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I would want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.",1
"Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit. Ok, alright, moving on. Oh, wow. A paisley shirt. It goes with my corduroy suit. If you mean it should end up in the same place, then I agree. Is this your only tie? Technically, yes. But, if you'll notice... It's reversible!",0
"She is miserable. Just to keep me upto speed Dorothy, it is this negligent arson that prospect of spending the rest of her wiening years in jail thing right? No itÕs the rose in the kitchen thing.",1
"You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings. Okay, my turn.

Can you read me? Over. (imitates walkie-talkie static) Yes, I read you, Sheldon. Copy that. Over. (imitates walkie-talkie static) What are you doing? I am talking to a man in space. If you don't have the (walkie-talkie static) then he might as well be at the Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.",0
"A gallant man would defend his fiance for being called a urethra. Can we please change the subject? Well, that didn't go your way. Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here? Uh, well, actually I came to see you. Really? Why? Ah, that's a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available.",1
"I will have one. Okay, I'm not gonna have one. No, no, it's just my tooth. All right I'll have one.",1
"Oh so pretty, this must have cost him a fortune. Oh c'mon Ross, remember back in college when he fell in love with Carol and bought the ridiculosly expensive crustal duck? What did you just say? Crustal duck. No, no, no, the love part? Oh my god! ThatÕs good, just keep rubbing your head. That will turn back time",1

I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been. So you're wandering all around by yourself?
That's not the kind of hero's welcome an astronaut should come home to. It's okay, you know, we space cowboys don't do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.",0
"Your mom called me. So is this her? No, this is a loaner. I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself. I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game?",0
"You mean when he was little. Not as little as you'd want him to be. You know, this stuff is horrible.
You want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee? Sure. We're going to the cafeteria to get some coffee.

"Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny's peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her? Well, I wouldn't put it exactly that way. How would you put it? Yeah, okay, like you said. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse.",0

"Damn. Well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won't be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard's lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb. Anyway, to this day, I still can't see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.",0
Thanks so much for helping me. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.,0
"It's nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine's Day can come here tonight and be together. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. In fact, there's no place I would rather be than here.",1

You wanna hear something that sucks. Do I ever. Chris says they're closing down the bar. No way!,0
"We clinked at the glasses, Stan gave me a toy smile and I winked at him And then I gulped down the champaigne in one go And it didn't go sdown smoothly Later Stan told me that he put my engagement ring in the bottom of the glass It turned up three days later. Where did it turn up Dorothy? On the home shopping network",1
"I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her. Oh, honey, I'm sorry. Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!! You had no relationship!!",0

And I'm pretty weird, so I think I know what I'm talking about. I don't know. Maybe it's all those steroids I've been taking. I think I'm gonna go. Thank you for the burrito and the pork rinds and the 20-minute lecture on why monster trucks are better than regular trucks.",1
"That's the rule. What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table! How'd you get to that? Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio",0
"You know what I knew something like this is gonna happen What are you doing? Chandler, you can't just go back a phase Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.",0
"Okay, that-that's all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is? Yeah, it's the new building on Avenue A. I'm supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.",0
"Thank you for driving me back to my hotel. Oh,it's not a problem. I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don't want someone like that operating heavy machinery.",0
"And this from cry for help department, are you wearing makeup? Yes I am, as of today, I am official Joey Tribbiani actor slash model. That's so funny because you look more like Joey Tribbiani man slash woman.",1

"Someone in there? No, this is just part of a daredevil game that I play called wait until last moment before I burst and die",1
"But if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me. Really? Yes. It's all on you. But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one knee, flowers.

"He can't go to space. He's like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book? You're kidding. No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book. I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't want to break up over this.",0

I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it.
It's one of my all-time favorites. It was very entertaining... despite the glaring story problem.",1
Because I met somebody who would be perfect for you. Ah you see perfect might be a problem. Had you said co-dependent or self-destructive.,1
"So, what should we talk about? Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. Leonard? Oh, we don't need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.",1
"Do you really want him to write back? Yeah, I do. No matter how he responds, I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying, ""Oh, really?"" Me-wow. I've, uh, created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper.",0
"So, what happens next? I can't tell you that.
But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment. Ooh, I'm gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.",1
"Yeah, I'm saying, it'd be easier to lift a car. What can I tell you? After I found the courage to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable. So, how is she? They're running tests-- I don't know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event. What's the difference? A heart-attack-like event is an event that's like a heart attack.",1
"So Rachel called, wants to see me. Going over in a minute. Wow, what do you think she wants? Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realizes that life without me a sucks. Its possible, you are very lovable. I'd miss you if I broke up with you. Just trying to be supportive.",0
"Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess. Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.",0

Item 29: Valentine's Day. Ah, the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey. Before you get upset, I believe I've come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy. People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead-- end with one.",0
"It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck! Yeah, yeah you have the ring? Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs? Oh! Oop!",0
"I am sorry I think I can walk the rest of the way now just give me my boots. I don't have your boots Well I don't have them either, where are they? Well why don't you check in one of my saddle bags while I chew on a bale of hay.",1
"Was there ever any doubt? Momentarily. This is strictly off the record, but Dirk's nearly five years younger that I. In what Blanche, dog years?",1
"So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer... ... and live forever as a machine! That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.",0
"Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life. Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya. Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.",0
"Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation. Chandler! He's your father.  he should be at the wedding. I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not that close. I haven't seen him in years. Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!",0

"Penny, I know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town, we don't churn our own butter, we don't make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin' don't get our hair cut by bottle-blonde... Sheldon, be nice. I'm sorry, it's the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair.",0
"So what'd you think? It was good. That's it? ""Good""? I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be ""losing my virginity,"" I didn't think you meant showing me <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> for the first time.",1
"the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. Is there something wrong with your neck? It's a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick. Have you considered massage? I'd like to respond to that sarcastically: Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.",1
"You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game. Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men. Pete, can I get you something else? Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given'  'em out.",0

"Maybe I should get another pair. Oh, you know they had some with uh, with  fringe all down the sides. Pheebs, you may know this, you know strange things. What is the boiling point of brain?",1
"Hey Sheldon. Hello Penny. Get anything good? Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics quarterly. Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't.",1
"Unlike you, I can actually talk to women when I'm sober. You fail to take into account that even mute, I am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty. You know the old saying, ""Pasty and frail never fail."" Excuse me, but what about me? Why don't I get a shot?",0
"like Mrs. Riley' s chicken. What's Mrs. Riley's chicken? A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley. Okay, forget the chicken. Well, I wish I could. No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard.

"Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair? No, but, actually, that was this guy's sister. All right, well, what do you think he wants? I don't know. You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there. I told you. That was a different guy. Hmm. That's too bad. We could have spent New Year's Eve waiting for the ball to drop.",1
Could you want her more? Who? Dee. The sarcastic sister from What's Happening.,1
"So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?",1
"There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, color and consistency. Disgusting. No, what's disgusting is he's still keeping track. Why do you need all this stuff...? No, no, no, no... Sorry! I am glad you asked. Yeah, are you familiar with the Higgs boson? Of course, it is... it's been in the news. And it's a very famous boson.",0
"Here you go. Great. Come on in. What, you don't say thank you? It's my suitcase.
I lent it to you two years ago. Well, then, I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle. So, is everyone from Bernadette's company going to Vegas? No, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs. It's part of a bonus she got.",0
"My God, she didn't! What could she possibly be talking about for so long? Obviously, waitressing at The Cheese Cake Factory is a complex socio-economic activity that requires a great deal of analysis and planning.",1
"Will you at least stipulate that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is inarguably the best? I have three words for you: Wrath of Khan. Thank God, you're here. What's the emergency? I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch. Where? On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think? On Mars!",1
You guys can pee standing up. We can? Ok I am trying that.,1
"Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus? My guess is, ""Hey, four minutes! New record!"" That's why I'm the funny one. Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff. They were closing up. We got this whole box for 60 bucks. We didn't even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here. There a new girlfriend in there? 'Cause you might need one.",1
"Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time! Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore? No! No!",0
"Enhh I've got canned goods. Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole! Excellent hole, Joe.",1
"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here. So, let's go. Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song. Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.",1
"Two week straight and she hasn't smoked since. So how did you guys meet? Oh I was in Mrs. Knight's oh I mean Alice, I was in her Home ED class. And he was my best student. Yes she was my best teacher. If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?",1
I want grilled cheese. Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?,0
"Glad you guys could make it. Of course. Wow, it looks really pretty in here. Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood.",1
"Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.",0
"Wrong. Leonard? Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth. Wrong, and let's keep it clean, shall we? Kangaroo, uh, I'd be Kanga-Jew. The first of my people to dunk a basketball. Also instead of just living in your mother's house, you could actually live inside her body.",1
No rose. Are you upset because Blanche is going to sell the house and we can't live together. No I am upset because Joe Piscapo didn't get the lead role in rain man.,1
"Oh. Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like  'Is it on the lose?'  'Is it watching me?' We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff. He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.",0
"Or maybe she just doesn't want to talk. Look, I found an iPod! It's smashed beyond repair. What are you gonna do with it? What else? Sell it on eBay as ""slightly used.""",0
"It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different. This is hard. Yeah I know. On the other hand in um, in about seven months you're gonna have something that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with.",0

"We thought you might like to join us for dinner? I get the feeling Dorothy that you might be a little mad at me. Why is that? How about stopping by new years eve with three naked women, throwing up in the pool, passing out in the punch bowl, and relieving yourself in the linen closet?",0
"Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet? Am I naked again?! We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes. Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?",1

"Now I'm going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I'm going to wear? Oh, not crazy at all.
And don't beat yourself up. When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine. That will not be in this week's e-mail blast. So, this spring, I get to go to the International Space Station. Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens.",0
"Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay?",0
"It's smashed beyond repair. What are you gonna do with it? What else? Sell it on eBay as ""slightly used."" It was Penny's boyfriend's, they broke up. Apparently, he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog which I cannot find anywhere. I'm gonna go back and try talking to her again. Good idea, sit with her.

"Um, no. You should get one. What's that? It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic. Oh, it's a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year. Oh, God, that is so romantic. Yeah, it was. Leonard's really one of a kind. Saying that while holding a snowflake is a bit heavy-handed, don't you think?",1

He also found an M and an O. We think it was trying to spell out monkey.,1
"Wow! This girl is good. Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before. I like her. Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?",1
"It was a compromise. I lost. Can you believe Stuart's walking around taking credit for this party? Who cares? What do you mean ""who cares""? Look at what I pulled off here.
The deejay's on fire, there's a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food! Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese. You're right, the party's fantastic. Please, tell me more. I haven't heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old!",1

"And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing Halo. Fine. We'll just play one-on-one until he gets back. One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not one-on-one. One-on-one. The only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half. Sure, cut the foreigner in half. There's a billion more where he came from.",1
"Then we'll avoid him, we'll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go. How's this? ""Pleased to meet you, Dr. Gablehauser. ""How fortunate for you that the university's ""chosen to hire you, despite the fact ""that you've done no original research in 25 years, ""and instead have written a series of popular books ""that reduce the great concepts of science ""to a series of anecdotes, ""each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration ""of an average bowel movement.",1

Sheldon, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing. Oh, you're hardly out of the woods, no.

My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more use r- friendly than Windows Vista. I don't like that. Don't you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?,0

"Hey, Sheldon. I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year's Chancellor's Award for Science. And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, I'll play.

"I promised my mother. I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that's something your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturer.

I just don't give a rat's ass. Would that be a giant rat's ass? For the record, giant rats are possible. Can we please talk about something else?

"All right. I'm no stranger to a little gray matter. Locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus. You're getting warmer-- it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. It's the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I'm sure it's no problem for a genius like you.",1
"You know what I just realized? Joker is poker with a J. Coincidence? Hey, that's Joincidence with a C",1
"I mean, you two are-are my… I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good Thanks man. I gotta go check something over here. What a baby.",0
Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me? Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it. I just have a question. Does Bernadette ever talk about me?,0
No! You let go! How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball? I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough. Hey! It's starting to snow.,0
"Hey Ross I was wondering. Oh my god, where are all the men?",0
"You went to President Seibert's house in the middle of the night? He didn't respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. Tell me what my other option was. You could have waited until morning. I know, look who I'm talking to. Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole? Hardly a day goes by when I don't think about it.",1
"Everybody's staring at me. Don't worry, they're more scared of you than you are of them. Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew? A superb choice. Oh, great. Provided he has already read and is familiar with the reestablishment of the DC multiverse.",0
Oh Dorothy would please open this jar of nuts for me? You couldn't get it open? Oh I didn't try. I don't wanna risk cracking a nail. What are these? Claws?,1

In Prison!!",1
"I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler. Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?",0
"Uh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter? In a way. We've kind of been involved in a five-year experiment. Oh. Well, you're lucky. He seems very talented.
And I'm sure a lot of people want to work with him. Well, a lot of people can't. Uh, hey. Where are we going? My limbic system wants to take your pants off.",0
"When that guy was robbing us and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, do you know what I was doing there in all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down. Yeah. But if I had known what kind of friend you would turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much. See you around! We got a box.",0
About what? He's planning your birthday party. Oh my God! I love him! You'd better act surprised.,0
Go over to her. She's not with anyone. Oh yeah right. And what would my opening line be? Excuse me,1
"See, by attaching RFID tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. I will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera. That does sound much simpler. How long is this going to take? Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes. Plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation.",1
"No, that was a different, different guy. Was he the one who used your head to open a nut? Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair? No, but, actually, that was this guy's sister. All right, well, what do you think he wants? I don't know. You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.",1
"Did I go to this school? Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her. Sure, nice. Dude. You're married to my sister. You are right, by saying nice, I am virtually licking her.",1

"I'm really glad Monica asked us out. I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch. You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.",0

"Ugh! It's like walking into the Amazon.
And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping.
The awful one with birds and snakes. You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain. Four keys!
Who does he think he is, a warden? See? Maybe you'll love living alone. I don't know. Perhaps. And if it turns out you don't... - you and I could live together. - You and... Oh, sure.",1
"and she makes me Froot Loops. Go with gay story, people are more accepting of that. Actually, Froot Loops just got married to a girl. Congratulations. Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch. You and Mrs. Loops have a big wedding? Not exactly. Listen, if you don't mind, I'm not really up for chatting. I'm just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes.",0
"Of course not. I'm a theoretical physicist.
A career I chose in no small part because it's indoors, but if I'm able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientis to confirm string theory. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life. Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death.",1
"in town were starting to say I was a witch. Sheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis. Oh, it's about time. I hated the old way. Hi. I'm Penny. Alex.

"So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not!",1
"What exactly do you think goes on here? Well...
conversations that you wouldn't be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. You know, who has the best cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Men's buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them. We were talking about Penny's job. And how difficult it is to do when she's bloated, cranky and crampy?",0
"You heard what he said about his parents. 
It was the little things they kept bottled up. 
I don't want that to happen to us. How can I convince you it won't? Well, is there anything about me you're keeping inside? I'm not answering that.
