"On the other hand, no arousal. None? None. Thank you for your time. Thank you. None at all? Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn't...",0
How do I look? Could you be more specific? Can you tell I'm perspiring a little? No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely.,1
"Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of American membership card? It's been in every wallet I've owned since I was five. Why? It says, ""Keep this on your person at all times."" It's right here under Batman's signature. and this is Leonard and Sheldon's apartment. Guess whose parents just got broadband. Leonard, may I present, live from New Delhi, Dr. and Mrs. V. M. Koothrappali.",0
"This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the planetarium. Well, I'm sorry, too, but there's just no room for you in my wallet.",1
"but it was between you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have dinosaurs. I'll miss you, too. Bye-bye. Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to stop. Oh, dear, I am rightly and truly screwed. Hey, I thought you were finding new friends. I've got some feelers out. In the meantime, listen to this.",0
"Did I miss anything? Did they kick Giselle off? Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment. Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine. Lucky for her I like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed.",1
"Who touched myâ€¦ Penny! Penny did it. Why would you do that? I don't know. I was hungry?
What's the big deal? The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.",0
"So, we're all standing around looking at the post-op X ray and there it is, clear as day, right in the guy's chest cavity...one of my earrings. Oh, my God, what did you do? What do you think I did? I discreetly slipped off the other earring, put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!",0
Can you open this for me? Can I see your stitches? Sure. Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.,0
What are you doing here? Hang on. 130 over 80. It's a little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk. Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff? My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday.,0
"Say what? That's basically what I just said. You brought your husband to work. You know the rules. Mesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha. Leonard, it's 1:00. Weren't you going to show me your laboratory at 1:00? There's no hurry. Tell them more about their secret love for each other.",0
"They're here. Stay calm. We don't know anything about them yet. What are you doing? I'm checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you? The box says ""kitchen."" So? Do cocaine smugglers write ""cocaine"" on the box?",1
"Come on. I think it's nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening. Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn't touched all the cheese. You know, it's kind of early.
Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee? Gee, it's a little late for coffee, isn't it? You think ""coffee,"" means coffee. That is so sweet.",1
"It's actually a very elegant system. You know, what goes around comes around. Speaking of what goes around comes around... Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely? It won't work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient. What if we reposition the collection tank? It won't work. No way to mount it. Okay, here's an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband, Avi, in Israel?",1
"I don't think I can go to the North Pole. I know you're concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low. Yeah, that's very comforting. Comforting is a part of leadership.
It's not a part I care for, but such is my burden. Terrific, it's just that... I don't think Penny wants me to go.",0
"What time is it? It's 7:00 a.m. I'm sorry it's early, but we're leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you. What did you mean when you said you were going to miss me?",0
"Let me ask you something. Do you think it's okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch? No, I mean, she's obviously way out of line. Thank you! But if she dumps you, she'll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you'll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one.",1
"That's why Leonard does it. Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles? A good question. Thank you. And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves: ""What is physics?"" Oh, balls. It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece. Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.",0
"Hello. Hello Alright dispense with the friendlt banter I believe you know why I'm here. Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords.",1
"Yes.
I'm Special Agent Page, FBI. You say you're Special Agent Page, FBI. Here's my I.D. And here is my Justice League membership card. But that doesn't prove I know Batman. I just want to ask you a few questions about Howard Wolowitz.",0
"Besides, Penny and I are having a girls' night tonight. Girls' night? What does that entail? Oh, you know, girls get together, hang out, share girl talk. I'm a girl. Oh. Well, maybe you can join us. I'll ask Penny. No need. Penny and I are very close. You are? Yes. In fact, our menses are synchronized. Penny. Bernadette tells me you're planning a girls' night.",0
"And here's where we are. The runts in a large litter.
unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones. So I guess it's a good thing we stopped for dinner. You know, guys, when facing disappointment, Eat, Pray, Love  teaches us Oh, shut up. ...so anyway, to make a long story short, turns out I have an unusually firm cervix.",0
"""And Absolon hath kist hir nether ye, ""and Nicholas is scalded in the towte.
This tale is doon, and God save al the rowte."" What the hell was that? Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. ""The Miller's Tale"" by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know. It would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.",0
"Stupid Aquaman. If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time. Whoa. You dated Penny? She didn't tell you? She told me she dated a guy named Leonard. Who would have thought it was you? Who else would it be? I don't know. Somebody bigger and... Yeah, sure. Why not you?",1
"I may have failed. Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman. I don't want to go without Penny. Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we've got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight. Obviously, we're no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.",0
"Why not ""World's Greatest Engineer""? I'm sorry.
I typed that into the label maker, but I just couldn't press enter. Now down to business. What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard. We're not quitting on Leonard. I understand. Your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to up the ante?",0
"Yes, I live with him.
I don't... I-I really don't know why. Tonight? Sure, that'd be great. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye. She wants to have dinner and talk about my research. An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?",1
"Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise. Cluck-cluck-cluck. Sheldon, look at me.
I think it's time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group.
Where he goes, the group goes. Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. I'm the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time. I'm not saying that you're not fun. You're the most fun person I know.",0
"I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy. Howard, you've got to tell your mother. Hey, have you told your parents you're dating this short glass of skim milk here? Uh... that's different.
First of all, we're not engaged; and second, Indian parents are very protective of their children. Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.",1
"What the hell is wrong with you?! Well...
You were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me. I'm nice to everyone! I'm sorry. Damn right, you're sorry! And you tell Howard there's never been anything between us! I will. Hey, Bernadette? What?! Do you think I have a shot with Penny? Of course you do. You're a cutie pie! Any girl would be lucky to have you!",0
"Wow. You're engaged to my friend. Hey, Bernadette doesn't mind where I get my motor running, as long as I park in the right garage. I can't believe you're engaged to my friend. Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick can't hear you.",1
"All-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet. 
And my personal favorite, Gunning with God. What's Gunning with God? I'm afraid to ask. Oh, it is a hoot and a half. You write your sins on a clay pigeon, they fire 'em up in the air, and you pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun full of our Lord's forgiveness. Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged to see how advanced your group has become-- willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.",1
"Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks. You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard. Not really, no. It's funny, huh, Leonard? Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser.
And now we're reversed. You're the winner. You'd think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.",1
"That was a really nice dinner. I'm glad you asked me out again. Me, too; I missed you. You see me all the time. You sure you just don't miss the sex? Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?",0
"(chimes) Wisten to me.
Not westauwant; westauwant. (chimes) I don't know what you mean by ""not westauwant; westauwant."" See? Total cwap.
You suck, Siwi. Hey, don't talk to her like that. 
She's a lady. Well, that wady took high-wes pictures of my junk wast night for Cwaigswist.",0
"Buzz Lightyear is not real. No, that's not what I'm talking about. Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real? No Okay, um... how about ""Crash""? 
Howard ""Crash"" Wolowitz. Yeah, terrific. The other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named ""Crash.""",1
"""Release the Kraken."" That never gets old. ""Release the Kraken!"" Oh, chills. Besides, I'm having dinner with Amy. Oh, okay. I'll just go home and be alone. W-Which is cool.
I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so...
Cool. Darn. If you weren't busy, I'd ask you to join us.",1
"the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right. And now he's on the fast track to win a Nobel prize. Yeah, that's basically what I said. The point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps I've already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize. I didn't know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.",1
"What do you think? Can I speak to you for a second? I'll be right back. Feel free to play with yourself. I don't care for your friend, he's being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave. Amy, I can't just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He's a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.",0
"(thermometer beeps) 102.2.
(coughs) Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It's like you're not even trying to get better.",1
"I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met. Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.",1
"That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious.
Now I'll never know what happened. Well, why don't you make up your own ending? Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I'll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I'll rub pudding on my gums. I'm going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.",1
"Roger is Raj. I always thought, if I had a white name, it would be Gavin. Keep reading. What does it say? No, no, I don't know if I should. 
If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would've told me. It's almost like I'm reading her diary. That's exactly what it's like. Keep reading. No, this is creepy. Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when I put up that camera.",0
"I just Googled ""foo-foo little dogs."" (Skype ringing) It's Raj. Stay quiet. (chuckles): Hey!
Bad timing.
Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk. Hmm. Interesting. 
Did they take a walk down Liars' Lane? What? A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar!",0
"Really? Yes. Huh. Yeah, I always took it literally. That's why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. 
Hmm. I'm relieved that you don't have a problem with us working together. Not as relieved as I'm about to be. It's a brave new world, little lady.",0
"Koothrappali murder mystery dinner. I'm leaving. You can't leave. 
You're a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom. (dramatic music plays) I didn't know his last name was Bloom. Yeah, it's Bloom. Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night? What do you think I was gonna do at home?",0
"We can't show up to your mom's empty-handed. 
We should bring something. I already am.
I'm bringing the gift of knowledge. Oh, boy. Despite what her Bible says, recent archeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn't exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later. I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.",1
"Well, I'm sure that, uh, you...
have a lot of questions. Who was he? His name is Ron.
I met him at my prayer group. How long have you been involved with him? A few months. And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?",0
"he used to... take me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did together. Oh. Howie, I had no idea. Well, I don't... like to talk about it. Oh, baby. 
That story's made up, isn't it? That's how much buying a comic book store means to me.",0
"There's nothing weird going on with me and your mother. Stewie, your bath is getting cold! I got to go, bye. Penny?
Penny.
Penny.
Penny.
Penny. You knocked more than usual. Next time I might be in a rush, it's good to have a few in the bank.",0
"It's nice they're getting exercise. Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt. I'm sure he brought it. No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it. He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there's an entire section of my dashboard that doesn't have any syrup on it.",0
"And I love that you're strong and independent. And yet, I still love when you hold a door for me. I love that I'm kind of a slob around here, and...
you're okay with that. Uh-huh. And I love that I work and do all the cleaning, and you're okay with that.",1
"Who will stand between us and flag ignorance"""" I know I was thinking that.
Is this a show on flags or mind reading? But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend. And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board. So as they say, all good things must come to an end.",0
"You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor's office was gonna just be boring, but then I found his dentures and realized it's also gross. Doesn't Professor Abbott's family want any of this stuff?",0
"Okay. On the count of three, I'll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out. Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?",1
"See, I've got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty. And then, oh, last but not least, this inspirational cat poster, improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman. Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?",0
"Can you please just let it go? Oh, I can help you with that. Imagine you're holding an ordinary pen. While your favorite pen is safe and secure in your pocket. Hold that thought. Hello? How can I make this up to you? The answer's in this puzzle box. Let's see if you can open it.",1
"Oh... then I choose a janitor.
'Cause I'm about to throw up. I'm in love.
Let's do something else. Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon.
Why don't the four of us go out? Okay. Sounds good. Should we call Howard and Bernadette? I don't know what time their plane gets in, but let me, let me shoot them a text. Did he say anything about the funeral? Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place.",0
"All right, Amy's in charge of pricing and being 75. Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this? Sure. Aw, we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time. Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong. Oh, I meant beer pong. I had a table, too, but I didn't have any friends, so all I did was serve. You know, you can leave one side up and play against it. And if I had a friend, they might have told me that.",0
"What's going on in here? I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan. How do you drink it? Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.",0
"When their pets pass on, they want them sort of laid out like they are sleeping. But, occassionally theres a person who wants them in a pose like chasing their tail or uh, jumping to catch a frizbee. Joey if I go first, I want to be looking for my keys",1

"[Laughs] Wow you look just like your son, Mrs. Tribbiani",1
"Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay  you that money back and I don't want that hanging on my head. Besides, soon as my insurance kicks in I' ll all the free operations I want. T'll probably start with that laser eye surgery. Joey's got a really bad hernia but its nothing that a laser eye surgery wont fix",1
"I am sorry, why did Phoebe and Mike breakup? Because his penis was too big. I am sorry, thatÃ•s the kind of thing I do.",0

"How old is that sock!. If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years, it would be talking too. Okay, I think its time to change somebody's nicotine patch. Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?",1
Still upset because I saw her boobies. Well what? What were you doing seeing her boobies? It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.,1

"There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you. Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.

"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight... No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend. Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...",0
