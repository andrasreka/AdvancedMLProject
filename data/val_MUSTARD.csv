How do I look? Could you be more specific? Can you tell I'm perspiring a little? No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely.,1
"but it was between you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have dinosaurs. I'll miss you, too. Bye-bye. Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to stop. Oh, dear, I am rightly and truly screwed. Hey, I thought you were finding new friends. I've got some feelers out. In the meantime, listen to this.",0
I'm with you. I just have to make sure if I'm a synthetic human I'd still be Jewish. I promised my mother. I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that's something your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturer. Not to mention you'd have to power down on saturdays.,0
"Or maybe she just doesn't want to talk. Look, I found an iPod! It's smashed beyond repair. What are you gonna do with it? What else? Sell it on eBay as ""slightly used.""",0
"What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?! What, Sheldon?! Tell me what you see here. The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?",1
"Hey. Hey. A little mood lighting, huh? When I didn't pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience.",1
"They're here. Stay calm. We don't know anything about them yet. What are you doing? I'm checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you? The box says ""kitchen."" So? Do cocaine smugglers write ""cocaine"" on the box?",1
"Or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude. Or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fiber requirements. Or his feelings about little marshmallows. Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man. Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099? You know this can go on all night. You know this can go on all night. Why don't you just come with us?",0
"Howard, what did you do? They're called tattoo sleeves. Look. I got them online. Raj got a set, too. Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery. You know, I've always wanted to go to a Goth nightclub.",1
When are you going to stop making Cylon toast? When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the Battlestar known as Galactica.,1
"Let me ask you something. Do you think it's okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch? No, I mean, she's obviously way out of line. Thank you! But if she dumps you, she'll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you'll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one.",1
"I am.
Are you interested in physics? Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn't gone into microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics.
Or ice dancing. Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we're testing the phase shift due to an electric potential. That's amazing. Yes. Leonard's work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.",1
"Hi. I'm Penny. This is my friend, Sheldon. We're not friends at the moment. Depends on how this goes. Right, right. Anyway, Sheldon here is a huge fan of yours, and he was supposed to meet you the other day at the comic book store, but he kind of ended up in jail. I see. And you thought you'd just come over to my house uninvited? You said we were invited. Oh, no, no, I said I'm inviting you to come with me to Stan Lee's house.",0
"Happy now? I'm moving the dirty sock. Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one. Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack. Hey. Hello. Whoa! Is that the laser? It's bitchin'. Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper <i>""Zur Quantentheorie der</i> <i>Strahlung,""</i> his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin'.",1
"Yes.
I'm Special Agent Page, FBI. You say you're Special Agent Page, FBI. Here's my I.D. And here is my Justice League membership card. But that doesn't prove I know Batman. I just want to ask you a few questions about Howard Wolowitz.",0
"""And Absolon hath kist hir nether ye, ""and Nicholas is scalded in the towte.
This tale is doon, and God save al the rowte."" What the hell was that? Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. ""The Miller's Tale"" by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know. It would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.",0
"to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins? No, Penny kissed me. Is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? That happens with me and my mom all the time.",0
"Thank you, Leonard. That doesn't make it sound boring at all. So, how you holding up? I'm fine. Oh, who are you kidding? She's breathtaking. So, Penny, Leonard tells me you're an actress. That must be pretty exciting. Oh, yeah, yeah. It's real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.",1
"Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise. Cluck-cluck-cluck. Sheldon, look at me.
I think it's time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group.
Where he goes, the group goes. Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. I'm the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time. I'm not saying that you're not fun. You're the most fun person I know.",0
"Um, no. You should get one. What's that? It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic. Oh, it's a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year. Oh, God, that is so romantic. Yeah, it was. Leonard's really one of a kind. Saying that while holding a snowflake is a bit heavy-handed, don't you think?",1
"Well, what makes me the weakest member? Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn't last a minute on the Serengeti. Okay, Amy, you're being silly. I'm not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don't have a problem with Leonard's new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.",1
"The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend. Hey! That's my sister and my country you're talking about. Leonard may have defiled one, but I won't have you talking smack about the other. You guys ready to order? Yes, I'd like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac-- to induce vomiting-- and a mint.",1
"Yeah, I'm saying, it'd be easier to lift a car. What can I tell you? After I found the courage to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable. So, how is she? They're running tests-- I don't know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event. What's the difference? A heart-attack-like event is an event that's like a heart attack.",1
"What are you doing? Oh, uh, Priya's calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date. It's 8:00 in the morning in Mumbai. 
How can she have dinner? Fine, whatever. 
Priya will be having breakfast. All right, so technically it's not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you'd open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, ""Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?""",0
"Oh, sweetie, guests don't normally wear corsages to a wedding. 
That's more of a prom thing. I never went to my prom. 
My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs. Put the corsage on her. When you're done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist. When you're done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.",1
"All-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet. 
And my personal favorite, Gunning with God. What's Gunning with God? I'm afraid to ask. Oh, it is a hoot and a half. You write your sins on a clay pigeon, they fire 'em up in the air, and you pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun full of our Lord's forgiveness. Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged to see how advanced your group has become-- willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.",1
"Three, sadly, are dead. Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother. Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again. Well, it's so nice to see you, too. I thought it was our Indians that had the occasional alcohol problem. We don't say that, either. I'll make you a list. Oh, that would be mighty white of you.",0
"Now I'm going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I'm going to wear? Oh, not crazy at all.
And don't beat yourself up. When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine. That will not be in this week's e-mail blast. So, this spring, I get to go to the International Space Station. Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens.",0
"Yeah, sure, come on in. Thanks. Want some mac and cheese? No. Lactose. Gas. Glass of wine? No. Sulfites. Migraines. Okay, well, I'd offer you Halloween candy, but that's gone. So, what's up? Okay, we used to go out, right? Oh, my God, that's where I know you from.",1
"Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair? No, but, actually, that was this guy's sister. All right, well, what do you think he wants? I don't know. You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there. I told you. That was a different guy. Hmm. That's too bad. We could have spent New Year's Eve waiting for the ball to drop.",1
"Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks. You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard. Not really, no. It's funny, huh, Leonard? Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser.
And now we're reversed. You're the winner. You'd think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.",1
"I don't think there's anything in this jewelry store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears. Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff. Ooh, a pocket watch. Okay, I don't think Amy wants a pocket watch. No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.",0
"This is amazing.
How did you even get this idea? I called your dad.
I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it. Okay, you're kind of really great. You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?",1
"You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings. Okay, my turn. 
Let me talk to him. Go ahead. 2311 North Los Robles Avenue, Pasadena, California to International Space Station.
Can you read me? Over. (imitates walkie-talkie static) Yes, I read you, Sheldon. Copy that. Over. (imitates walkie-talkie static) What are you doing? I am talking to a man in space. If you don't have the (walkie-talkie static) then he might as well be at the Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.",0
"the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right. And now he's on the fast track to win a Nobel prize. Yeah, that's basically what I said. The point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps I've already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize. I didn't know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.",1
"Uh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter? In a way. We've kind of been involved in a five-year experiment. Oh. Well, you're lucky. He seems very talented.
And I'm sure a lot of people want to work with him. Well, a lot of people can't. Uh, hey. Where are we going? My limbic system wants to take your pants off.",0
"You are now the only woman in my life who I'll see naked in the bathroom. I know this wasn't easy.
You doing okay? Oh, I'm fine.
It's just her I'm worried about. Aw, she'll be okay.
She's a grown woman. I know. 
It's just ever since my dad left, I've felt responsible for her. That's a lot for a kid to deal with. She was just so sad all the time. Yeah, I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and Ben and Jerry.",0
"(thermometer beeps) 102.2.
(coughs) Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It's like you're not even trying to get better.",1
Do you really think you should be drinking right now? How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady? I don't know. Seek professional help? I did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.,0
Do you think Penny's mad at me? Because you're in the right lane behind a bus and you won't go around it? I'm sure she finds it charming.,1
"Koothrappali murder mystery dinner. I'm leaving. You can't leave. 
You're a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom. (dramatic music plays) I didn't know his last name was Bloom. Yeah, it's Bloom. Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night? What do you think I was gonna do at home?",0
"We can't show up to your mom's empty-handed. 
We should bring something. I already am.
I'm bringing the gift of knowledge. Oh, boy. Despite what her Bible says, recent archeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn't exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later. I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.",1
"So, what happens next? I can't tell you that.
But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment. Ooh, I'm gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.",1
"And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping.
The awful one with birds and snakes. You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain. Four keys!
Who does he think he is, a warden? See? Maybe you'll love living alone. I don't know. Perhaps. And if it turns out you don't... - You and... Oh, sure. And while we're at it, why don't we get engaged, too? Why don't we get a little house, start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself, woman?!",1
"to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. Maybe she can practice on you some time. Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor. Yeah. I'm sure that'd be fine. I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them? Um... okay, I guess. I'm with him three years, nothing. She's with two minutes, and he's taking his pants off.",0
"You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dump Leonard? Why say it? Yes! Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we're playing fast and loose with the word list. Well, good job. Now she hates me. Great. On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you're going to lose next.",1
"Like what? Your incomplete set of <i>Star Trek</i> collector plates? For your information, I just bought the last one I needed on eBay. Without asking me? There were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition Scotty from a smoke-free home. How much, Howie? Not a lot. How much? Let's not talk about this in front of our friends.",0
"So, what are you working on these days? I'm studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame. What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about? Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.",1
"A gallant man would defend his fiance for being called a urethra. Can we please change the subject? Well, that didn't go your way. Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here? Uh, well, actually I came to see you. Really? Why? Ah, that's a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available.",1
"Okay, why? I'm listening to you snore. I'm wondering how I'll ever sleep without it.",1
"It's nice they're getting exercise. Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt. I'm sure he brought it. No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it. He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there's an entire section of my dashboard that doesn't have any syrup on it.",0
we decided that the time was right to take a step forward. Okay. Do you want to say it? Let's say it together. We're getting a turtle! This is why I've been saying we should keep champagne on ice.,1
"So, I put stickers on everything we're gonna sell.
We just need help taking it all out to the driveway. Can I be in charge of pricing?
I've been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel? All right, Amy's in charge of pricing and being 75.",1
"It's not like I was invited to Richard Feynman's house and have anything better to do. Is this how the rest of the night's going to be? I don't know the future. Do you think there's a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman's house and everyone in it? No, Sheldon. Then buckle up; you're in for a cranky night.",0
"Hey, you guys the water is great. You should really go in! Oh, uh, no thanks. I just had an M&M.",1

"Okay thatÕs like the least fun game ever. Well I am really sick of your smoking. So I brought something that is going to help you quit. Nope, that patch is no good.",1
"Two week straight and she hasn't smoked since. So how did you guys meet? Oh I was in Mrs. Knight's oh I mean Alice, I was in her Home ED class. And he was my best student. Yes she was my best teacher. If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?",1
"Maybe I should get another pair. Oh, you know they had some with uh, with  fringe all down the sides. Pheebs, you may know this, you know strange things. What is the boiling point of brain?",1
Look out! You almost crushed my hat Sorry And the bunny got away!,1
"[Laughs] Wow you look just like your son, Mrs. Tribbiani",1
"Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay  you that money back and I don't want that hanging on my head. Besides, soon as my insurance kicks in I' ll all the free operations I want. T'll probably start with that laser eye surgery. Joey's got a really bad hernia but its nothing that a laser eye surgery wont fix",1
"You know whats sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two, cause on the thrid day my mother killed herself, so I was partly crying for that. See now that I see crying over, but Bambi, is a cartoon.",1

"I know, I opened it up and it  and there it was just floathing in there, like this tiny little hitchhiker. Maybe it's a contest, you know? Like ""Collect all five"".",1

"Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, ""Oh that poor girl."" Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone. Oh my God! What?",0
"It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different. This is hard. Yeah I know. On the other hand in um, in about seven months you're gonna have something that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with.",0
